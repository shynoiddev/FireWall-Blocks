-Independent Mode Control Improvements : Shizuku and VPN modes now operate independently. The "Enable/Disable" button now controls only the mode currently displayed.
-Smart Shizuku Prompt: Added a non-intrusive bottom bar to quickly "Open" or "Download" Shizuku if the service is not running or the app is missing.
-Quick Menu Access: Added an "Open Shizuku" shortcut directly to the 3-dots menu (in Shizuku mode).
-Improved Startup Logic.
-Other bug fixes.
