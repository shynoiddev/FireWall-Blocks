FireWall Blocks is a simple, open-source Android firewall that blocks app internet access using either Shizuku or a local VPN, with no root requirement.

Features:
* Dual Mode: Choose between the efficient Shizuku mode (recommended) or the no-setup-required VPN mode. You can even use them at the same time!
* Per-App Rules: Control Wi-Fi and Mobile Data access for each app individually.
* Import/Export: Save and load your firewall rules as a simple .json file.
* Sorting: Sort lists based on user and system apps.
* Efficient: The app doesn't need to be constantly running in the background.
* Elegant Reapplying: Hassle-free user experience on startup.

How to Use:
1. Enable the Firewall: Press the "Enable" button on the main screen.
2. Choose Mode: Toggle between "Shizuku" (requires setup) or "VPN" (works instantly).
3. Block Apps: Tap the Wi-Fi or Data icons next to any app to block its access.

Note: After rebooting your phone, for Shizuku mode, you must first start Shizuku, then re-open the app to re-apply the rules.
