# **FireWall Blocks**

A simple, open-source Android firewall that blocks app internet access using either Shizuku or a local VPN, with no root required.

## **Features**

* **Dual Mode:** Choose between the efficient Shizuku mode or the no-setup-required VPN mode.  
* **Per-App Rules:** Control Wi-Fi and Mobile Data access for each app individually.  
* **System Apps:** View and manage rules for system apps.  
* **Import/Export:** Save and load your firewall rules as a simple .json file.  
* **No Trackers:** A privacy-focused app built for transparency.

## **How to Use**

1. **Enable the Firewall:** Press the "Enable" button on the main screen.  
2. **Choose Mode:** Toggle between "Shizuku" (requires setup) or "VPN" (works instantly).  
3. **Block Apps:** Tap the Wi-Fi or Data icons next to any app to block its access.  
4. **Reboot:** After rebooting your phone, you must open the app and press "Enable" again to re-apply the rules.
